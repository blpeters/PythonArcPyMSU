# Python and ArcPy Scripting

Scripts created for Python and ArcPy Geoprocessing

#### Highlights:
- FinalProject_BrettPeters.py: Custom script added as a custom toolbox to ArcGIS Pro
    - INPUTS: Shapefiles of endangered/threatened species obtained from the USFWS and current US wildfires
    - OUTPUT:
        - New feature data set in current geoDatabase
        - All individual species split into individual feature classes
        - Points added at all habitat locations impacted by current wildfires.
        - Resulting output used to make example map below.
 
#### Possible Improvements:
- I would love to add additional code to automate obtaining the latest wildfire shapefiles from USFS/ESRI.
- Make species selectable from a list collected from a file database to easily select a series of species and quickly create custom maps.
